# G3 Firmware Programming

Simple shell scripts for programming the G3 flyPanels and the panels controller using [avrdude](https://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/). Quicker than using AVR Studio and can be used on Linux.

This repository serves as an archive, the code is not actively used (or maintained), and the benefit over the [Firmware repository]({{site.baseurl}}/Generation%203/Firmware/docs/) is unclear.
